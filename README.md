# Games Finder Beta

🎮 Welcome to Games Finder - Beta Version

Games Finder is a project created for a university course, with a primary focus on the backend using PHP. Please note that the design and UI/UX are basic and old-fashioned due to an emphasis on minimizing the use of CSS during development.

## Note

During the creation process, I was a beginner, and I am eager to enhance this project. I plan to create an upgraded and remastered version, incorporating best practice coding standards and improved UI/UX design. Stay tuned for future updates!
